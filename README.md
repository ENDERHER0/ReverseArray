The provided Java function is designed to reverse the order of elements in an input array and return a new array with the aforementioned reversed order. 

The function begins by conducting a null or empty input array check. If the input array is found to be null or empty, it returns the same array. 

Otherwise, the function creates a new array of identical size as the input array and proceeds to loop through the input array in reverse. During each iteration, the function assigns each element to the corresponding index in the new array. 

Once all elements have been assigned and the loop has been completed, the new array with the reversed order is returned. 

This function provides a useful utility for Java programmers seeking to rapidly reverse the order of an array without modifying the original array.

I learned you can initialize more than 1 variable in a loop.
